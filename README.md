Background:
We talked about decision trees last week. Decision trees are when a specific event is triggered based on certain conditions. This can be a decision that is made by a player or actions taken by other entities in a game based on a condition. 

Decision Tree with If Else:
In programing, there are if-else statements that analyze a current condition, and perform certain actions based on that condition. Each decision in a decision tree is like an if-else statement in code. For example, a pong decision tree could look a little bit like this in code:

Instructions:
1. Fork and clone this remote repository to create a development environment on your computer
2. Pick an existing game and make 3 simplified decision trees inspired by events in the game. (sometimes it's easier to draw it out first)
3. Modify the code template I give you within Visual Studio Code. 
4. Add changes from the working directory to the staging area. 
5. Commit the changes WITH a message about which game and characters you chose.
6. Push your commit to the remote repository. 
7. Create a pull request for your commit. 

Hint: Use the cheat sheet found in files on canvas to help.
